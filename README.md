# Bananas & Apples

This is my React Three Fiber experiment with apples! Finding model assets on [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/popular) and preparing them in Blender was one of the things I enjoyed about this project. I also was able to implement optical effects (like depth of field) and good lighting! I followed [Paul Henschel](https://twitter.com/0xca0a) course to achieved many of the features implemented. Make sure to check out his [course!](https://0xca0a.gumroad.com/l/B4N4N4S)
