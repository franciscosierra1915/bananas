# bananas & apples

This is a project I worked on following [@0xca0a](https://twitter.com/0xca0a) - He is the lead developer behind react-three-fiber, react-spring, zustand, drei, and other open-source libraries. React-three-fiber was one of the very first things I learned when starting my joruney into code. I like creating 3D experiences on the web! 

The curriculum for this project goes as follows:

Deconstruction of playful.software

Setting up a dev environment from scratch

Expressing Threejs in React

Animation basics

Finding and preparing (in Blender) model assets

Displaying and composing them

Use effects and good lighting
